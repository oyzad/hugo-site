<h1 id="the-porter">The porter</h1>
<p>The porter appears on the stage in a drunken stupor.
His character serves as comic relief.
There are hidden messages in the soliloquy</p>
<ul>
<li>adds unsettling humour to the soliloquy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>knock, knock, knock. Macbeth knocking at the gates of his own hell abandoning his humanity for an evil or fiendish nature.</li>
<li>ironically imagines himself to be the porter of the gate of hell “if a man were porter of hell-gate, he should have old turning the key.”</li>
<li>he then imagines three people approaching the gates of hell</li>
<li>A farmer who stored up grain in hope of making a profit but kills himself when a good harvest lowers the price</li>
<li>an equivocator who covers up his crimes with the skill of his tongue</li>
<li>a tailor who is discovered cheating his customers by cutting cloth out of the garment he sells</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="macbeths-sins">Macbeth’s sins</h2>
<ul>
<li>These three characters represents a different sin that is in Macbeth.</li>
<li>The farmer overreaches but loses everything instead</li>
<li>The equivocator reveals how Macbeth is a skilful liar who pledges unfailing allegiance to the king yet murders him in cold blood</li>
<li>the tailor makes the clothes look better than they are. Macbeth&rsquo;s false aspirations for the crown he is essentially clothing himself in a lie</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ending">Ending</h2>
<ul>
<li>He ends the soliloquy with the question “What are you?”</li>
<li>The porter breaks the fourth wall, seeming to speak to the audience- asks us what one of the sinners we are.</li>
<li>this line would have made the audience question their own morality</li>
</ul>
<p>The porters last line “I pray you, remember the porter.” Perhaps a warning to the audience not to follow Macbeth’s traitorous exampleThe madness and humour in the porter’s speech amplify the horror of the play as a whole.</p>
